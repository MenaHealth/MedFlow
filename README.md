This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/med-flow.git
cd med-flow
npm install
```

- Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

- to log in, contact a senior developer with the most recent .env file, then put the .env file at the root of the med-flow folder.

- work on your assigned feature, and once you are ready to submit a pull request, run 
```bash
git fetch 
git pull
git add files/that/were/updated
git commit -m "feature name, feature description, etc"
git push
```
- go to your GitHub and submit a pull request.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
